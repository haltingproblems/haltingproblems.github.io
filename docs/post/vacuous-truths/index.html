I want to explain why this homepage is named Vacuous Truth. It is
because I love the concept of vacuously true logical statements.
Besides the fact that a vacuous truth is a part of math and
logic—which makes me love it by default—I especially love this concept
because it is the basis of &#34;smartassery.&#34;</p>

A simple example
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-1" class="outline-text-2">
<img src="runningman.svg" alt="runningman.svg" title="A sketch of a running man" class="width-50p center"/>
<p>
It is weird to think about jackass middle school children leveraging a
concept they likely have not learned about and perhaps never will. But
it happens to be true. When a teacher tells a student &#34;no running in
the halls&#34; a smartass doesn&#39;t see this as a rule but as an
opportunity. A teacher means to imply no running in all the places
where it may be dangerous including the halls, but the smartass hears
that they may run in all places except the halls. The enterprising
smartass will immediately put this to the test by running in a
classroom, a stairwell, or on the roof.</p>
<p>
A smartass can not help but test the logically flawed rule the teacher
has made. In our example running on the roof is following the rule and
a smartass must use this as a flex to put the teacher in their place.
The rule as constructed by the teacher is the proposition <em>P</em> &#34;if in
the hall&#34; and the conclusion <em>Q</em> &#34;running is not permitted.&#34; When <em>P</em>
is false there&#39;s nothing the statement logically says about running,
so by running on the roof the statement is true and the rule has been
followed. Obviously, this smartass student deserves praise for
following the rules. Not so fast smart guy!</p>
<p>
To the student&#39;s dismay, this behavior is rarely praised. The teacher
implicitly knows, as do most responsible adults, that the rule was
only followed because in the case of running on the roof (i.e. not in
the hall) the statement is vacuously true and rules followed vacuously
are subject to another rule: smartasses will be disciplined.</p>

<h2 id="headline-2">
A crass example
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-2" class="outline-text-2">
<img src="knife.svg" alt="knife.svg" title="A sketch of a knife" class="width-75p center"/>
<p>
The fun with vacuous truths never ends. Consider the statement &#34;I do
all my murders with that knife.&#34; If I was being interrogated by the
police and they brought a knife to the interrogation room to demand I
admit to killing someone with the knife I would instinctively want to
respond:</p>
<p>
<em><strong>I do all my murders with that knife!</strong></em></p>
<p>
It would be so tempting. Thankfully as an adult, I&#39;ve learned the hard way
that smartasses will be disciplined. Indeed it will be better for
everyone involved if I do what any good lawyer would instruct and
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-7o9xYp7eE">don&#39;t talk to the police</a>.</p>
<p>
I know I&#39;ve picked a crass example, but it makes this all the more fun
since the statement at face value would be so shocking. Not only did I
murder with the knife, but I&#39;ve confessed to multiple murders. Cops,
like teachers, don&#39;t appreciate clever smartasses and have certainly
never been introduced to the universal quantifier.</p>
<p>
This little joke would probably force me to attempt teaching
mathematical logic to the police, jury, and parole board. All the
while I could take solace in how clever I was in phrasing my denial
while sitting in my prison cell.</p>
<p>
The domain of discourse that I constructed is the set <em>M</em> of every
murder I&#39;ve committed, since I&#39;ve never committed a murder <em>M</em> is
empty, thus it is true that all the murders were done with the knife
because I&#39;ve never murdered.</p>
<p>
It is also true that I always murder on Tufurnetherwanday (the day
between Tuesday and Wednesday) at precisely the 25th hour in the
township of New Smartassastan.</p>
