I need to spill the tea on the Homebrew package manager, but first
some praise. Homebrew is a really good name. It&#39;s cute! Its chock-full
of Apple history: the <a href="https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_1692121">Apple I</a> computer was introduced at <a href="https://www.computerhistory.org/revolution/personal-computers/17/312">the Homebrew
Computer Club</a>.</p>
<img src="./hb-club.jpg" alt="./hb-club.jpg" title="Jobs &amp; Woz at the Homebrew Computer Club" class="center"/>
<p>
The name evokes nostalgia, I&#39;m getting a warm feeling just thinking
about retro computers. The clickety-clack of the mechanical keys, the
low-frequency grind of floppy drive, the smell of the electronics and
the printed manuals. Even Terminal.app ships with a retro theme called
Homebrew.</p>
<img src="./homebrew-theme.jpg" alt="./homebrew-theme.jpg" title="Screenshot of Terminal.app show the Homebrew theme" class="center"/>
<p>
Homebrew also has a great out-of-the-box experience. Installation is a
single command you paste into your shell. By default, there’s no
configuration to fiddle with, no path to set, and no permissions to
worry about. I believe this handful of of positives account for its
popularity, however simple they might be.</p>
<p>
With that said, this post presents <em>some</em> of the problems I’ve
encountered using Homebrew. They&#39;re not the biggest problems or the
most egregious, but I think they&#39;re the easiest to understand and the
most relatable.</p>
<div id="outline-container-headline-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="headline-1">
Cutesy names gone wild
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-1" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
The cutesy name by itself is fine. But when you over-extend the
metaphor to actual home beer brewing (<a href="https://americanhistory.si.edu/blog/papazian">thanks, Jimmy Carter</a>) and force
beer nouns onto a package management system, things quickly go off the
rails.</p>
<p>
Thus, we have Casks, (poured) Bottles, Taps, Kegs, Formulae, Recipes,
Cellar, Caskroom, and others. I have no idea what “key only” is
supposed to mean. I kind of get &#34;taps&#34;, but these terms are mostly
baffling.</p>
<p>
<em>Stop it!</em></p>
<p>
It’s <strong>package manager</strong>. It installs <strong>packages</strong> from <strong>source</strong> or as
<strong>binaries</strong>. Packages are organized and indexed in a <strong>package
repository</strong>. Use the nomenclature that we have all agreed on.</p>

<h2 id="headline-2">
Package managers package packages
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-2" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
It might seem obvious, but a package managers purpose is to package
and manage packages for you. The unforgivable sin of a package manager
is to not package something you need or worse to print a cop-out when
you request a package be installed.</p>
<p>
When I evaluate a package manager I check for a few packages: it needs
to have Emacs and its variants, CLI only, the NextSTEP (Emacs.app
package) variant, X11 variant, etc; it needs to have XQuartz on a Mac
and X11 on Linux, obviously; it should package TeX Live too.</p>
<p>
Screw any of this up and you don’t have a package manager suitable for
my use case. When Homebrew first came on the scene I recall at least
TeX Live and XQuartz not being available. I seem to remember something
wrong with Emacs too, maybe it didn&#39;t have the NS/app variant.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a id="footnote-reference-1" href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup></p>
<div id="outline-container-headline-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-3">
The case of TeX Live
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-3">
<p>
Historically Homebrew would not install TeX Live.</p>
<div class="src src-text">
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span class="line"><span class="cl">$ brew install tex-live
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">Installing TeX from source is weird and gross, requires a lot of
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">patches, and only builds 32-bit (and thus can&#39;t use Homebrew deps on

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">We recommend using a MacTeX distribution: http://www.tug.org/mactex/</span></span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
Homebrew no longer prints this cop-out. It may seem unfair to bring up
Homebrew&#39;s historic behavior, but I think it highlights a flaw in the
philosophy of Homebrew that persist to this day. Homebrew punts on
anything that&#39;s tricky. Building software is weird and gross? As a
package manager, that&#39;s literally your job!</p>
<p>
Nowadays, instead of a cop-out, Homebrew directs you to use the Cask
system. Homebrew hard-codes two packages for blanket refusal, the
first is Xcode which is understandable (although disappointing), the
second is TeX.</p>
<div class="src src-text">
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span class="line"><span class="cl">$ brew install tex-live
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">Warning: No available formula or cask with the name &#34;tex-live&#34;.

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">  brew install --cask basictex</span></span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
Casks, however, come with their own set of problems. A Cask, as far as
I can tell, is a Homebrew abstraction over the <code class="verbatim">installer</code> program and
the <em>installation package</em> format (<code class="verbatim">.pkg</code> &amp; <code class="verbatim">.mpkg</code>). That means the
underlying implementation is closed source and the package are macOS
only. Consequently, even if the upstream software is cross-platform,
the Cask is not—not even on Linuxbrew.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a id="footnote-reference-2" href="#footnote-2">2</a></sup> This also means the
packages are binary only and any compile-time options are
inaccessible.</p>

<div id="outline-container-headline-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-4">
What the deal with macFUSE?
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-3">
<p>
At some point you may want to install a macFUSE filesystem like
<code class="verbatim">bindfs</code>.</p>
<div class="src src-text">
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span class="line"><span class="cl">$ brew install bindfs

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">closed-source macFUSE!</span></span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
I don&#39;t care if it is closed-source. Homebrew has a lot of other
closed-source software available, why is macFUSE different?</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-5">
Other deliberately disabled package
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-3">
<p>
There are about 120 additional disabled packages. Many of these are
FUSE based file systems and others are for reasons like
&#34;unmaintained,&#34; &#34;doesn’t compile,&#34; or &#34;license issues.&#34; One is left
wondering why a package manager should make decisions about licensing
for you? Especially Homebrew, that facilitates installing
closed-source binaries, it isn&#39;t like it&#39;s a GNU package manger with a
strict ideology.</p>
<p>
Anything marked &#34;doesn&#39;t compile&#34; makes me question if this is a case
of something being truly broken or a case of &#34;installing […] from
source is weird and gross?&#34; I suspect the latter.</p>

Forced Upgrades
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
There’s nothing I hate more than software that tries to &#34;help,&#34; but
gets it wrong. That’s the opposite of helpful—that’s Clippy.</p>
<img src="./clippy.png" alt="./clippy.png" title="Clippy being a d*ck" class="center"/>
<p>
Homebrew will update itself and upgrade all your outdated packages if
you make the unfortunate decision to perform the innocuous task of
installing an unrelated package. It will do this even when installing
a package that has no dependencies in common with your installed
packages.</p>
<p>
I know some people will claim that this is no big deal or even
desirable in the age of continuous updates and moving targets. Maybe
to understand the peril you need an update to break your system.</p>
<p>
There is a legitimate argument for updating and upgrading when new
packages are installed, but why not notify the user that continuing
will update and upgrade other packages? Give the user a way to back out
before performing sweeping changes that may break their setup.</p>
<p>
Yes, there is an environment variable <code class="verbatim">HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE</code>. But
you&#39;ll only go looking for it <em>after</em> Homebrew has borked your system
once or twice.</p>
<p>
Configuration via environment variables have risks too. If you set
<code class="verbatim">HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE</code> in your Bash <code class="verbatim">.profile</code> then switch to Zsh
without porting all of your <code class="verbatim">.profile</code> to <code class="verbatim">.zshrc</code>, the next time you
run <code class="verbatim">brew</code> you could be in a world of hurt. This is not just a
hypothetical, I just did it to myself:</p>
<p>
I set my login shell to tcsh and a few days later tried to install
<a href="https://www.shellcheck.net">ShellCheck</a> for the making sure my <code class="verbatim">#!/bin/sh</code> scripts are POSIX
compatible (it seemed especially prudent while running a non-Bourne
shell).</p>
<p>
The <code class="verbatim">HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE</code> environment variable does not stop every
forced upgrade either, so with or without it set <code class="verbatim">brew install</code> is a
ticking time bomb.</p>

Homebrew is a little slow
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-7" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
Homebrew is mostly Ruby. The <code class="verbatim">brew</code> command is implemented as a Bash
script that execs (or sources) additional Bash scripts and Ruby
scripts, but that&#39;s an implementation detail. There&#39;s a few Swift
files too. But since it is mostly Ruby it is slow. You can expect
about 1 second of wall clock overhead for any invocation of <code class="verbatim">brew</code>.</p>
<div class="src src-text">

</div>
<p>
Repeat invocations of <code class="verbatim">brew</code> do speed up thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/bootsnap">bootsnap</a>, but not
by much.</p>

</div>
<p>
At the time of this writing Homebrew returns 147 packages for the
search and it takes 13 and ½ seconds.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a id="footnote-reference-3" href="#footnote-3">3</a></sup> For contrast, the
same search with MacPorts:</p>

<div id="outline-container-headline-8" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="headline-8">
Search in name only
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-8" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
What really irks me isn&#39;t that search is slow, it&#39;s the terse output
and lack of long descriptions. It would be nice if search would, at
least optionally, display additional information such as the version
and short description.</p>
<p>
There is a <code class="verbatim">--desc</code> option, but it changes the search semantics rather
that optionally displaying some additional information about the
packages returned by the query. It broadens the search to include
descriptions. This, however, is absurd for Homebrew because many
package have no description or the descriptions are so short they
don’t provide additional keywords to match against.</p>
<p>
Many other package managers have categories and long descriptions of
packages that aid package discovery. Homebrew&#39;s vim description is &#34;Vi
&#39;workalike&#39; with many additional features.&#34; If somebody wanted to see
every text editor in Homebrew the search <code class="verbatim">brew search --desc editor</code>
will not return vim. In fact, this search skips many available text
editors because nobody thought to include &#34;text&#34; or &#34;editor&#34; in the
descriptions. Contrast Homebrew’s vim description with the description
in FreeBSD Ports:</p>
<div class="src src-text">

Poor package info
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-9" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
One consequence of the bad search interface is that I always find
myself having to use <code class="verbatim">brew info</code> to ensure I’m installing the correct
package and because there’s no long description, I almost always find
myself using <code class="verbatim">brew home</code> as well. The repeat <code class="verbatim">brew search</code>, <code class="verbatim">brew
info</code>, <code class="verbatim">brew home</code> cycles are painful and clunky. The pain is
compounded by Homebrew&#39;s slowness.</p>
<p>
Homebrew’s info command format is crowded, hard to read, and contains
a lot of extraneous information. Keeping with our vim theme, here is
vim’s info as presented by Homebrew:</p>

Conclusion
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-10" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
Homebrew has some good qualities, but they can be easily replicated by
existing package manager or new package managers. Creating a package
manager with a good cutesy name. Now that&#39;s the hard part. Trust me,
Windows has a package manger called <a href="https://chocolatey.org">Chocolatey</a> 🤢.</p>
<p>
There&#39;s no good reason to stretch a metaphor so thin as to give
components of your package manager confusing names. Additionally a
package manager should be good at building software and should have a
plentiful package repository. Homebrew fails all of these.</p>
<p>
Don&#39;t automatically perform actions that can take a long time or that
can break stuff. Especially don&#39;t update and upgrade packages unless
at user&#39;s request or with the user&#39;s consent.</p>
<p>
Slow isn&#39;t the worst thing for a package manager, but if you have to
be slow—at least make sure you make up for it in some way.</p>
<p>
Now for the kicker, I&#39;m still using Homebrew, at least for now. I&#39;ve
tried so many package managers over the years and there&#39;s no
one-true-package-manager. They all do things that are baffling and all
do things that are genius. My ideal package manager would take the
best of <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/PackageManagement">APT</a>, <a href="https://www.macports.org">MacPorts</a>, <a href="https://www.pkgsrc.org">pkgsrc</a>, <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs">Nix</a>, and yes, even <a href="https://brew.sh">Homebrew</a>.</p>
<p>
Is it possible? I don&#39;t know, but I started building a package manager
by accident. I was attempting to improve the build system for <a href="https://www.xquartz.org">XQuartz</a>
when I realized I had essentially built a mini-package manager with
package recipes, dependency graphs, incremental builds, patch phase,
and so on. It is called <a href="https://github.com/pkgmgr/pkgmgr">pkgmgr</a> and it is a work in progress.</p>
