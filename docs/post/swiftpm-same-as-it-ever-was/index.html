After working on a framework built with Objective-C, I bundled the
framework variants into an XCFramework and set up a <code class="verbatim">Package.swift</code>
manifest for distributing SDK releases. While doing so, I ran into the
following conundrum:</p>
<p>
I want to make releases like this: bump the version number, make a
release commit; build the binaries and embed version identifier in in
the binaries as <code class="verbatim">Framework vM.m.p:branch@hash:config</code> (where <code class="verbatim">M</code> is
major, <code class="verbatim">m</code> is minor, and <code class="verbatim">p</code> is the patch components of the version
string); create the release on GitHub with the tag <code class="verbatim">vM.m.p</code> and attach
the binaries to the GitHub release. Binaries are available in both
signed and unsigned variants—so no binary voodoo is possible, even
if that would fix my problem.</p>
<p>
Trouble is the Swift Package Manager expects the package manifest at
the root of repository named <code class="verbatim">Package.swift</code> and to deliver binaries,
the package manifest must contain URLs to the ZIP&#39;d binaries and
checksum of those ZIP files. That means I&#39;d have to make a second
separate commit to update the package manifest—now the binaries
point to the commit before the package manifest was updated and the
manifest tagged at <code class="verbatim">M.m.p</code> actually points to the previous release.</p>
<p>
The framework is a commercial open source product, but I don&#39;t want to
support peoples &#34;modifications&#34; in the wild. They&#39;re free to do so,
but if they send a support ticket and the log shows a version
identifier that didn&#39;t originate in my source tree, good luck.  In
reality I wouldn&#39;t be so harsh, just send me your changes as a
PR—then I can help.</p>
<p>
So to fix this I have two bad options, don&#39;t embed the branch and hash
info for all builds, meaning <code class="verbatim">M.m.p</code> could be any built version from
<code class="verbatim">M.m.p</code> ahead by some arbitrary number of commits. Or build separate
Swift PM only binaries with version identifiers of the from <code class="verbatim">Framework
vM.m.p:branch@hash+swiftpm:config</code>, so I know <code class="verbatim">hash</code> is probably
equivalent to <code class="verbatim">releasetag^</code>.</p>
<p>
I picked the latter option. That means Unity, CocoaPods, Carthage, and
manual integrations will always be uniquely identifiable, but I have
to do extra work for Swift PM and the version identifier is just a
crumb trail.</p>
<p>
Other potential options could be putting <code class="verbatim">Package.swift</code> in a separate
repo, but that sucks too. Or putting <code class="verbatim">Package.swift</code> in an orphaned
branch, but that would still mean the release tags are wrong for Swift
PM. Nevertheless, both these options would require telling publishers
that they have to do <em>extra</em> stuff to make Swift PM work and that&#39;s
error prone at best.</p>
<p>
Anyway, just ranting. Unless I&#39;m overlooking and obvious way to break
a cyclic graph. Package managers are great, until they&#39;re not.</p>
