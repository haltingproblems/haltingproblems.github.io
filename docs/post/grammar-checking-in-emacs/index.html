<p>Grammar checking is apparently an error prone task. Or at least it has
been claimed: <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/sandeep/check">http://faculty.washington.edu/sandeep/check</a></p>
<p>Looks like there is <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/diction/">GNU
diction</a>, but it just highlights
potentially misused words. It doesn&rsquo;t indicate where an error
occurred. I&rsquo;m not comfortable investing much time into getting this
working with Emacs. Since there doesn&rsquo;t appear to be much return for
the effort.</p>
<p>I came across <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/BaoqiuCui">Baoqiu Cui</a>'s
EmacsWiki user page. Baoqui has created a grammar checker for Emacs and
links to his package from his page. There aren&rsquo;t many details, but the
screenshots on his user page appear promising. The package can be
found here <a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/bcui-emacs/source/default/source">https://code.google.com/archive/p/bcui-emacs/source/default/source</a></p>
<p>This will be my attempt at getting it working with Emacs.</p>
<p>According to Baoqiu&rsquo;s
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/bcui-emacs/source/browse/trunk/grammar/README">README</a>
file the package uses the <a href="http://www.abisource.com/projects/link-grammar/">Link Grammar
Parser</a>. The first
step looks like I should install the Link Grammar Parser. The parser
is available from <a href="http://www.macports.org">MacPorts</a>.</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo port install link-grammar
</code></pre>
<p>As can bee seen in the
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/bcui-emacs/source/browse/trunk/grammar/grammar.cc">grammar.cc</a>
in Baoqui&rsquo;s package we need the link-includes.h file to be on our
system. Let&rsquo;s verify that the MacPorts package included that file.</p>
<pre><code>$ port contents link-grammar | grep &quot;link-includes&quot;
/opt/local/include/link-grammar/link-includes.h
</code></pre>
<p>So, yup this is included. The next thing we need to do is download
Baoqui&rsquo;s package. We&rsquo;ll have to checkout the source code from its repo
hosted on the now <a href="http://code.google.com">defunct Google Code</a>. I
like to keep third-party source code in my <code>~/src</code>
directory.</p>
<pre><code>$ cd ~/src
$ svn checkout http://bcui-emacs.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/grammar grammar.svn
A    grammar.svn/grammar.el
A    grammar.svn/grammar.cc
A    grammar.svn/README
A    grammar.svn/Makefile
U    grammar.svn
Checked out revision 51.
</code></pre>
<p>We need to fix up the <code>Makefile</code> so that <code>gcc</code>
knows where to find the include file we installed with MacPorts. This
is as simple as changing one line in the <code>Makefile</code>.</p>
<pre><code>INCDIRS = -I. -I/opt/local/include/link-grammar
</code></pre>
<p>Next we&rsquo;ll attempt to run make. Hopefully this will compile without
incident.</p>
<pre><code>$ make
g++ -g -I. -I/opt/local/include/link-grammar -c grammar.cc
In file included from grammar.cc:28:
/opt/local/include/link-grammar/link-includes.h:16:40: error:
link-grammar/link-features.h: No such file or directory
...
grammar.cc:30: error: expected constructor, destructor, or type conversion before â€˜intâ€™
make: *** [grammar.o] Error 1
</code></pre>
<p>Looks like we got a few screen fulls of errors. Let&rsquo;s investigate the
first. <code>gcc</code> says it can&rsquo;t find the file
<code>link-features.h</code>. The first thing I want to do is check
that it was included when we installed the Link Grammar Parser with
MacPorts.</p>
<pre><code>$ port contents link-grammar | grep &quot;link-features&quot;
  /opt/local/include/link-grammar/link-features.h
</code></pre>
<p>Okay, the file exist in the MacPorts package. This means something
else is wrong. I suspect that the path we changed in the include file
is wrong for the way <code>link-includes.h</code> is expecting our
includes to be setup. My guess is that <code>link-includes.h</code>
references the missing file using its parent directory and then the
include file, so it would look like <code>#include
&ldquo;link-grammar/link-features.h&rdquo;</code>. This is a common pattern in
C. We can easily check this using <code>sed</code>.</p>
<pre><code>$ sed -n 16,16p /opt/local/include/link-grammar/link-includes.h
#include &lt;link-grammar/link-features.h&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>So, my theory was correct. Well have to fix the <code>Makefile</code>
and fix the <code>grammar.cc</code> file.</p>
<p><code>Makefile</code></p>
<pre><code>INCDIRS = -I. -I/opt/local/include
</code></pre>
<p><code>grammar.cc</code></p>
<pre><code>#include &quot;link-grammar/link-includes.h&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re ready to try running <code>make</code> again. This run
should compile correctly.</p>
<pre><code>$ make
g++ -g -I. -I/opt/local/include -c grammar.cc
g++ -g -llink-grammar -o grammar grammar.o
ld: library not found for -llink-grammar
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
make: *** [all] Error 1
</code></pre>
<p>This one is easy, it&rsquo;s just a linker error. Since we&rsquo;re using MacPorts
we need to tell the linker where to find Link Grammar Parser&rsquo;s library
file. Since we installed the library with MacPorts we know the library
will be in <code>/opt/local/lib</code>. We just need fix the
<code>Makefile</code>.</p>
<p>First change: add a <code>LDFLAGS</code> variable to the
<code>Makefile</code> right after the <code>INCDIRS</code> variables.</p>
<pre><code>LDFLAGS=-L/opt/local/lib
</code></pre>
<p>Next change the <code>all</code> rule to use the new
<code>LDFLAGS</code> variable.</p>
<pre><code>all: $(objects)
    g++ -g $(LDFLAGS) -llink-grammar -o grammar $(objects)
</code></pre>
<p>Now this thing should finally compile.</p>
<pre><code>$ make
g++ -g -L/opt/local/lib -llink-grammar -o grammar grammar.o
</code></pre>
<p>Awesome! It worked. Now we can move on to getting this working in
Emacs.</p>
<p>Copy the files into your <code>~/.emacs.d/site-lisp</code> directory.</p>
<pre><code> $ mkdir -p ~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/grammar
 $ cp grammar ~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/grammar
 $ cp grammar.el ~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/grammar
</code></pre>
<p>Then add the following to your <code>~/.emacs</code> file.</p>
<pre><code>;; Grammar Checker
(add-to-list 'load-path &quot;~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/grammar&quot;)
(add-to-list 'exec-path &quot;/Users/eddie/.emacs.d/site-lisp/grammar&quot;)
(autoload 'grammar-mode &quot;grammar&quot; nil t)
</code></pre>
<p>Now we can try out <code>grammar-mode</code>. Switch to a buffer for
typing (<code>*scratch*</code> is as good as any). Turn on
<code>grammar-mode</code> by typing <code>M-x grammar-mode</code>. Now
try typing one of the examples from Baoqiu&rsquo;s user page. You&rsquo;ll have to
type two spaces or a newline after you type the period to get
<code>grammar-mode</code> to check the sentence. I did example 2.</p>
<pre><code>The books is good for beginning reader.
</code></pre>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see the words &ldquo;The&rdquo;, &ldquo;books&rdquo;, &ldquo;for&rdquo;, and &ldquo;reader&rdquo; underlined
with green. This means there are some grammar errors. You can,
obviously, fix the errors by changing the sentence to the
following. Remember you need to type two spaces or a newline after you
type the period.</p>
<pre><code>The books are good for beginning readers.
</code></pre>
<p>You can also use the mode&rsquo;s shortcut to run a check on the sentence
before or at the current point. The shortcut is <code>C-M-g</code>.</p>
<p>Caveats: there isn&rsquo;t an interactive mode like <code>ispell</code>. So
you have to check the grammar as you type it or one sentence at a
time. You can&rsquo;t just type your document and as a final step check your
grammar. The other big issue I have is that there is no description of
the error. The last issue I have, which is least important, is that
there are no suggestions for correcting the errors.</p>
